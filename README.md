| `1_hello` | Basic "Hello, world!" program â€“ your first Rust app |
| `2_functions` | Functions and basic parameter/return usage |
| `3_simple_types` | Primitive data types and operations |
| `4_control_flow` | If/else, match, and basic control structures |
| `5_string_example` | String manipulations and methods |
| `6_control_flow_strings` | Combined string operations with control flow |
| `7_ownership_example` | Understanding Rust's ownership system |
| `8_ownership_references` | References and borrowing rules |
